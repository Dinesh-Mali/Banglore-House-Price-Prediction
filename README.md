# Banglore-House-Price-Prediction
We are building Machine Learning Model to predict the price of house and also automated the training using Auto Sklearn.

# Introduction
Main aim of this project is to predict the correct housing prices for a given locality in Banglore using Machine Learning Techiniques 
and Auto Sklearn.

# Motivation
What are the things that a potential home buyer considers before purchasing a house?
The Location, the size of the property, vicinity to offices, schools, parks, restaurants, hospitals, etc.
But the most important factor is - Price.

# Auto SK Learn
Auto sk learn frees a machine learning user from algorithm selection and hyper - parameter tuning. 
It leverages recent advantages in Bayesian Optimization, Meta-learning and ensemble construction.

# Project Flow

1) Data Analysis - Finding out Different relations.

2) Feature Engineering - Processing the data before it feeding to the model.

3) Model Building using ML - Using ML/Dl Algorithms.

4) Model Building using Auto ML.
